## My process
I completed the challenge using scss which was fun but i had a bit of trouble with css positioning but it really turned out great.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- [SASS/SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/)

### What I learned

- SASS Partials
- SASS Functions

### Continued development

As mentioned I had a bit of trouble with CSS position so I would see myself having refined it future projects as well as my mastery of CSS/SCSS.
